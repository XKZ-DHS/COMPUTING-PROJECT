Data about the happenings on [DATA REDACTED] at [DATA REDACTED]:
Act 1 1900 Hours
The boy hid near the trees, unable to find his family. It was setting, the sun. The soft warm glow of the sun slowly disappeared as the boy started to crumble down, his resilience
chipping away slowly as the minutes passed. Soon, darkness would be upon the land. He layed on the ground defeated, his tired body flat on the icy cold floor. "Hey kid, get up." 
a gruff voice resounded. The boy open his eyes ever so slightly, woken up by a voice. He could see the blurry sight of a big buffy man looking at him. He got up, but his legs crumpled
on his weight and he immediately fell. Realising he was unable to get up, the man carried him up. The boy's eyes slowly closed for the second time. The man got a firm grip on the boy 
boy back to his house. "Where... where am I?" The boy said hoarsely. " You are in my house, I... rescued. no. saved you. From the cold." "Oh, thank... thanks!" The man smiled. 
It had been a while since...
Act 2 2000 hours
"Keep an eye out, he has to be somewhere here." "We should go back g-guys, we are really in deep water if we don't go now!" "What do you think will happen to us if we do go back 
now? It'll be worse than going back without Jin later". Jared, Jill and Leonard climbed the ice cold mountain in the freezing cold, in search of their one friend, that they lost so 
carelessly in a game of hide and seek. "Come, I think I see a light!" "Let's go! It is!" The three ran only to find a dying flame and something... burnt. "What is this? It looks
weird." Jared commented". "I don't know, but throw it away, its useless." "Wait!" Jill exclaimed. "That's Arthur's ring!""Wait, you mean the lost kid?" "Yeah."
Act 3 2300 hours
"Oh no, Jill's down!" Jared shouted. *thud* "Leonard?" Jared's eyes widened as he stared at his two best friends lying on the ground. He collapsed onto the floor, defeated and tired,
his legs freezing cold and weak. "Hey kiddo, you alright?" Jared's eyes  remained barely opened, his breath running short as the cold started getting to him. Come on,
let's get you to a safe place..." Jared's vision blurred and the last thing he saw was the dead body of his friends, frozen, and left to die...


Act 4. Finale, 3 Days later
"Hey Ronney, did you see the recent news?" "Yes. Poor things, stuck and lost in a winter night." "Wait. Honey, look at this, they arrested a man on the mountain! And... he was charged
for..." Their eyes widened in terror as they read the last word. Cannibalism.
