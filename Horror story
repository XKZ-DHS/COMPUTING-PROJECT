Act 1 1900 Hours
The boy hid near the trees, unable to fimd his family. It was setting, the sun. Soon, darkness would be upon the land. "Hey kid, get up." The boy stared weakly at the blurred 
sight of a big buff man looking at him. He got up, his body shivering nonstop from the frosty cold winter air. He got up feebly and held the buff man's hand. The man brought the 
boy back to his house. He fed him before giving him a warm coat to wear to keep warm. The man smiled. It had been a while. 
Act 2 2000 hours
"Keep an eye out, he has to be somewhere here." "We should go back g-guys, we are really in deep water if we don't go now!" "What do you think will happen to us if we do go back 
now? It'll be worse than going back without Jin later". Jared, Jill and Leonard climbed the ice cold mountain in the freezing cold, in search of their one friend, that they lost so 
carelessly in a game of hide and seek. "Come, I think I see a light!" "Let's go! It is!" The three ran only to find a dying flame and something... burnt. "What is this? It looks
weird." Jared commented". "I don't know, but throw it away, its useless." "Wait!" Jill exclaimed. "That's Arthur's ring!""Wait, you mean the lost kid?" "Yeah."
Act 3 2300 hours
"Oh no, Jill's down!" Jared shouted. *thud* "Leonard?" Jared's eyes widened as he stared at his two best friends lying on the ground. He collapsed onto the floor, defeated and tired,
his legs freezing cold and weak. "Hey kiddo, you alright?" Jared's eyes  remained barely opened, his breath running short as the cold started getting to him. Come on,
let's get you to a safe place..." Jared's vision blurred and the last thing he saw was the dead body of his friends...


Act 4. Finale, 3 Days later
"Hey Ronney, did you see the recent news?" "Yes. Poor things, stuck and lost in a winter night." "Didn't you see the news? The latest one. They were found. Well, not really found. 
They were in pieces. Scattered! Anyway, they are not the first! There have been occurences there for THREE YEARS!"
