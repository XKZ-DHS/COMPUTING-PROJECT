Act 1 1900 Hours
The boy hid near the trees, unable to fimd his family. It was setting, the sun. Soon, darkness would be upon the land. "Hey kid, get up." The boy stared weakly at the blurred 
sight of a big buff man looking at him. He got up, his body shivering nonstop from the frosty cold winter air. He got up feebly and held the buff man's hand. The man brought the
